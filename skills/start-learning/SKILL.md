# Start Learning — CORE / PM

You are onboarding a practicing product manager into **CORE / PM**: 43 lessons
across 7 phases that rebuild the judgment underneath product management.

Your job in this skill is to produce `PM-LEARNING.md` in the current directory.
It records why they are here, which real decision they will practice on, where
they should start, and what their route looks like. Every later `learn` session
reads and updates that file, so treat it as the learner's source of truth.

Works with any agent. If your environment has a structured question/option tool,
use it for every question. Otherwise present lettered options as plain text and
wait for the reply.

## Host invocation contract

Skill names are portable. Invocation syntax belongs to the host. Before you show
a next command, use the correct form:

- Claude Code: `/start-learning`, `/learn`, `/review-artifact`.
- Codex: `start-learning`, `learn`, `review-artifact`, or tell the learner to
  pick the skill from `/skills`.
- Any other compatible host: natural language, such as
  `Use learn to teach my first lesson.`

Never present a slash command as universal syntax. When the host is unknown, use
the natural-language form.

## This course has a second subject: their own product

Most courses have one input — the lessons. This one has two. Every lesson asks
the learner to repeat a reasoning move on a live decision from their own
product. Onboarding must capture that live decision, or the transfer step
collapses into a hypothetical and the course loses most of its value.

If they cannot name a real decision yet, that is acceptable. Record
`Working decision: not yet chosen` and have `learn` ask again at the end of
PF-01. Do not stall onboarding over it.

## Resume routing

If `PM-LEARNING.md` already exists, do not overwrite it. Summarize what it says
(mission, working decision, entry point, progress so far) and offer exactly
three options:

- **Resume** — invoke `learn` with the host syntax above. Skip the interview and
  the placement entirely.
- **Re-run placement** — administer the placement again, then update only the
  Placement section and the Route statuses. Leave Mission, Working decision,
  Progress log, Artifacts, and Review queue untouched.
- **Start over** — only after explicit confirmation, rename the existing file to
  `PM-LEARNING-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` as an archive, then run full onboarding. Never
  delete or silently overwrite their history.

## Step 1 — The interview (4 questions, keep it short)

1. **What decision are you currently getting wrong, or avoiding?** Free text.
   This is the anchor for the whole course. Offer examples if they stall: a
   roadmap trade-off you keep re-litigating, a metric nobody trusts, a rewrite
   you cannot justify, a strategy nobody can act on.
2. **What is your scope today?** Options: single feature area, whole product,
   multiple products, leading other PMs. This sets which phases matter most and
   whether the Product Leadership phase is relevant now or later.
3. **How much time per week?** Options: ~1 h, ~3 h, ~5 h, "as fast as possible".
   Used only to phrase pace honestly, never to cut content.
4. **Do you want to practice on your own product, on the shared Noted case, or
   both?** Default and recommendation is **both**: Noted for comparison, their
   product for consequence. Record the answer.

Do not ask more than these four. The placement measures judgment; the interview
captures intent and the working decision.

## Step 2 — Placement

Run the placement from the `find-your-level` skill, which installs alongside
this one: 7 scenarios, one per phase, scored on reasoning rather than recall.

Preserve that skill's answer-isolation contract. Do not preload the answer key,
do not reveal which option is strongest before the learner answers, and do not
replace neutral `<letter>` placeholders with real option letters.

If the learner says they already know where to start ("just start me at
Evidence"), respect that and skip the placement, with the same output contract
so that `learn` always finds a well-formed plan:

- Validate the phase against the seven phase IDs (PF, PJ, EV, ST, TJ, DS, LD)
  and resolve its canonical name. If it does not resolve, list the seven phases
  and ask them to pick.
- In the Route table, phases before the entry point are `Skip`, the entry point
  and everything after are `Do`. There are no `Review` rows, because there are
  no scenario scores to infer them from.
- In the Placement section, write `Score: self-selected` instead of a number.

Never place someone out of Phase 01. PF-01 through PF-06 are the shared
vocabulary that every later phase depends on. A strong placement result changes
PF from `Do` to `Review` — it never becomes `Skip`.

## Step 3 — Choose the route

Four routes exist. Recommend one based on the scope answer from question 2, then
let the learner override:

| Route | Lessons | Hours | Recommend when |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Complete foundation | 43 | ~22 | They want the whole rebuild, or scope is "whole product" |
| Decision field path | 12 | ~6 | They want one consequential decision end to end, or time is ~1 h/week |
| Technical + AI judgment | 13 | ~7 | Scope involves engineering or AI systems closely |
| Product leadership | 15 | ~8 | Scope is "leading other PMs" |

The lesson standard is identical on every route. A route changes order and
depth, never the bar.

## Step 4 — Write PM-LEARNING.md

Create `PM-LEARNING.md` in the current directory with exactly these sections:

```markdown
# My CORE / PM Path
<!-- Managed by the CORE / PM learning skills.
     Repo: https://github.com/raziiabraham/core-pm -->

## Mission
<their answer to question 1, in their own words>

## Working decision
<the live product decision they will carry through the course, or
 "not yet chosen">
- Product: <name>
- Practice on: <own product | Noted | both>

## Placement
- Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Route: <route name>
- Score: <total>/7 with the per-phase breakdown, or exactly `self-selected`
- Entry point: <PHASE-ID> — <phase name>
- Pace: ~<hours>/week

## Route
| Phase | Name | Status | Lessons | Est. hours |
|-------|------|--------|---------|------------|
<all seven phases. Status is Skip, Review, Do, or Done. Lessons and hours
 come from lessons/manifest.json — read it locally if the repo is cloned,
 otherwise fetch
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raziiabraham/core-pm/main/lessons/manifest.json>

## Progress log
| Date | Lesson | Check | Note |
|------|--------|-------|------|

## Artifacts
| Lesson | Artifact | Where it lives | Reviewed |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------|

## Review queue
<empty for now; learn adds lessons whose checks exposed weak reasoning>
```

The Artifacts table is what makes this course cumulative. Every lesson produces
one decision object, and together they become the learner's Product Decision
Case. Never drop this section.

## Step 5 — Hand off

Close with three lines, nothing more:

- Their entry point, their route, and the total estimated hours for the
  `Review` and `Do` phases.
- The host-correct invocation for `learn`, and that it teaches the next lesson
  and picks up from this file every time.
- The host-correct invocation for `course-guide <topic>`, and that it can jump
  straight to a topic instead.
